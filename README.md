# Introduction

This repository contains collection of code, documentation, and sample outputs which have been produced for various data science, wrangling, and analysis projects. 

# Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to keep versions of code for future development use and to continue contributing to when new or improvements to existing code is produced

# Contents

- [x] ### Data_Science_sample.ipynb (Python, PySpark)
_Extract, transform, analyse and visualise web log data. Train supervised and unsupervised models._

### GUID performance by data type (Power BI)
_A [public Power BI report](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMjQ2MWM5ZTUtMDJlYi00YThlLWE5MGUtMGIwNzQ5Y2E0N2RjIiwidCI6ImU3ZTAzMWZjLWY1MGEtNDA2OS05NWE5LTZmNGQ4OTgxYzdmMiJ9)
 which investigates the difference in processing performance between data types_

### GUID_performance_script (R)
_The script behind the GUID perfomance Power BI report which is used to run the performance test_

### TaxonomyPerformanceTest.csv

_Output of 'GUID_performance_script.R', and used as an input to the Power BI report._

### Linear_Regression_sample.ipynb (Python)

_Train a linear model for predicting temperature by reading a weather patterns dataset and identifying significant features which correlate with temperature_

### Data_Analysis_in_R (R, .Rmd)
_Extract, transform, and analyse healthcare facilities data._

### Data_Analysis_in_R_2 (R, .Rmd)

_Extract, transform, visualise, and analyse emergency department data._

### Machine_Learning_sample.ipynb (Python)

_Train a model to predict a class/category using machine learning techniques such as Clustering, ANOVA & Chi-Squared feature selection, dimensionality reduction_

### EDR_Senior_Analyst (Rmd)
_A markdown file used to assess the technical competency of potential developers, using a version of the iris flower dataset with bugs deliberately introduced_

### SampleDataset.csv
_Used as an input for 'EDR_Senior_Analyst.Rmd'_

### working_location_script

_A script which reconciles latitude / longitude coordinates to locations which are entered as free-text. For example: "Melbourne", "Melbourne 3212", Melbourne VIC" should all result in the same latitude / longitude coordinates. This is useful for plotting free-text geographic information on a map visual._

### Documentation > Documentation sample

_An example of documentation including data transformations, modelling, lineage and brief wireframe._

### Documentation > Wireframe sample

_A wireframe for a proof-of-concept Power BI report_
